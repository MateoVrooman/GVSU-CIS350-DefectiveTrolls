# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)

This game will be built on the Godot 4 engine, and will be played on pc or mac computers. The game will be written using GDScript, a custom language for Godot that is similar to Python 3. We may need to use a pixel art drawing application to work on some art for the game as well. For version control we will be using Github and Git

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

Using the Godot 4 engine, and open source tilemap art from the internet, we will write scripts to procedurally generate dungeons. We will also create a player character, who can be controlled by the player using the keyboard. More non-player characters will also be created. We will work collaboratively on programming the various characters and environments, and will conduct regular meetings throughout the semester to keep on track. 

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

Major milestones for this project will be getting a basic world for the player to move around in. After that, implementing procedurally generated maps will be a major milestone that may take 2-4 weeks to implement well. During that time enemy and friendly NPCs can be added to the game and tested along with the player character. After this, small details about gameplay like combat, dungeon layouts, and a death and rank up system will be the next milestones.
