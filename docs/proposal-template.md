# Introduction

In our group we have decided to hone in on the game genre of a Roguelike. We also are leaning towards the hack n slash variant as we feel that a bullet hell may be out of our current skill range. Our theme we agreed on is the Cyberpunk/futuristic theme and we have made general decisions on what texture packs we would like to use as well as character packs.

Our implementation plans for our game are to add items to enhance the player character that can be added to an inventory. We plan to also hopefully implement an NPC system with vendors and small questlines to gain more powerful gear. Another feature we hope to add is crafting for potions such as healing, speed, power buff.

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems

Our main problem at the moment is time conflictions as well as not all of us being familiar with Godot and Gscript. We all come from various different coding backgrounds so it may be harder for some of us to grasp certain coding concepts that others might excel at.
