# Introduction

In our group we have decided to hone in on the game genre of a Roguelike. We also are leaning towards the hack n slash variant as we feel that a bullet hell may be out of our current skill range. Our theme we agreed on is the Cyberpunk/futuristic theme and we have made general decisions on what texture packs we would like to use as well as character packs.

Our implementation plans for our game are to add items to enhance the player character that can be added to an inventory. We plan to also hopefully implement an NPC system with vendors and small questlines to gain more powerful gear. Another feature we hope to add is crafting for potions such as healing, speed, power buff.

# Anticipated Technologies

This game will be built on the Godot 4 engine, and will be played on pc or mac computers. The game will be written using GDScript, a custom language for Godot that is similar to Python 3. We may need to use a pixel art drawing application to work on some art for the game as well. For version control we will be using Github and Git

# Method/Approach

Using the Godot 4 engine, and open source tilemap art from the internet, we will write scripts to procedurally generate dungeons. We will also create a player character, who can be controlled by the player using the keyboard. More non-player characters will also be created. We will work collaboratively on programming the various characters and environments, and will conduct regular meetings throughout the semester to keep on track. 

# Estimated Timeline

Major milestones for this project will be getting a basic world for the player to move around in. After that, implementing procedurally generated maps will be a major milestone that may take 2-4 weeks to implement well. During that time enemy and friendly NPCs can be added to the game and tested along with the player character. After this, small details about gameplay like combat, dungeon layouts, and a death and rank up system will be the next milestones. 

# Anticipated Problems

Our main problem at the moment is time conflictions as well as not all of us being familiar with Godot and Gscript. We all come from various different coding backgrounds so it may be harder for some of us to grasp certain coding concepts that others might excel at.
